# ![][ga-logo] Project 3: Build a Full-stack App as a Team

### Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and 
exercises, but this time **we’re going to challenge you to work on a 
whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in 
designing your own project, your instructors will partner you with other
classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an app of 
your own design.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** 
It’s a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's
most likely what you’re going to find yourself doing in your first 
development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work 
together.**

### Technical Requirements

Working in a team is going to require more "upfront" planning...

#### Your team must:

- **Document your app's RESTful API** in the **readme**.
- **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team, and manage
  and distribute those user stories to team members based on skills and
  interests using a project management tool like **Trello**.
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using Git, GitHub and a standard team work-flow.  Here are some references:
    - [Team Workflow Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFYyTZwMyAg) 
    - [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
    - [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)
- **Present the app at the end of the sprint** as a team.

#### Your app must:

- Use **MongoDB & Express** to CRUD your data.
- **Produce a RESTful JSON API that exposes at least one model**.
- **Authenticate users using an OAuth provider**.
- **Restrict access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of resource(s) 
  using an authorization middleware function**.
- Be **deployed online** using **Heroku**.

#### You do not need to, but may:

- Make a single-page app (SPA). You can also create a hybrid where, for example, the authentication initiates a full-page refresh but most functionality is performed via client-side AJAX and rendering.
- Use Web Sockets for real-time communication between clients and server.

### Necessary Deliverables

- A **working app, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the 
  Internet.
- A **link to your hosted, working app** in the URL section of your 
  Github repo.
- A **team Git repository hosted on Github**, with frequent commits from
  *every* team member dating back to the *very beginning* of the project.
- **A `README.md` file** with:
    - Explanations of the **technologies** used (including outside APIs).
    - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**.
    - A link to your **Trello**.
    - A link to your **Trello** board that contains your **user stories**, **ERD**, and **wireframes**.
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** 
      your team had to overcome.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

1.  **Identify roles** on the team, which may be (but are not limited to):
    
    - **Scrum Master**: the leader of the Agile processes (stand-ups, 
      retro) and manager of Trello.
    - **GitHub Manager**: the primary person for running Git and 
      managing the team workflow of merging pull requests, etc.
    - Product Owner: the person in charge of the product's user stories
    - Documentation: the person in charge of the README, etc.
    - Designer: the person in charge of style.
    - Database manager: this person will be in charge of creating and
      managing the models and datasets used in the process.

    You *don't have to fulfill any of these roles!* They are only there
    in case someone on the team *really* wants to "own" these things.
2.  **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
3.  **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but 
    you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified
    effort.
4. Do your best to have only one dev working on a certain file between commits.  This will avoid merge conflicts. This is another reason to separate responsibilities between team members.
5.  **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something 
    because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
6. Pair programming can be a great way for team members to share knowledge and contribute to the project.

### Potential Project Ideas

For this project, we want you to work with your team to build a creative product that you actually think someone will want to use. We won't have  time to do tons of customer research, but take some time to brainstorm. If you're struggling for ideas, the ones below could help get you started.

##### Bucketli.st

Besides finishing WDI, you surely have one or two things you'd love to 
do with your life. Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a 
third-party location-based API to allow users to search for a location 
or venue to add to their bucket list items.

##### Survey App

Imagine sending out a survey to everyone in the class – what should we 
eat for lunch today? Or 1-5, how well did you understand what we just 
learned? It would be even more awesome if it were realtime, so you could
 see answers pouring in as they're submitted.

##### Real Time Quiz App

Imagine everyone logging on and being presented with a multiple choice question.
Everyone has 1 minute to answer before the question is closed out. After a minute
they see a graph of each number of votes for each answer before moving on to the next question.

### Retros and Code-Reviews

Following the project sprint, all teams will participate in an internal
retro about the process of the project. This will produce a retro document.

The teams will also participate in one (or more) preliminary code review during
project week with the instructors.
